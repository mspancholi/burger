# Node Express Handlebars


This is a burger logger app with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORM.  The app is called Eat-Da-Burger!  
It is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.  Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.  Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
